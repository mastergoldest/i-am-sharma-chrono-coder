    <h1><a href="#">ABOUT SHARMA</a></h1>
    <p>"Greetings, temporal travel. i am Anya Sharma, a digital sorceress from the feature. My playground is the timeline, and my tools are lines of elegant code. i specialize in temporal data manipulation, predictive algorithm design, and ethically questionable yet undeniably effective time-loop optimizations. i believe that every bug is an opportunity to rewrite history, and every challenge is merely an unoptimzed timeline waiting for my tounch"</p>

<h2>LITTLE FUN OF MY SKILLS</h2>
<div class="grider">
<div class="together">
    <h3>Temporal Debugging:</h3>
    <p> 
        * Description: Not just finding bugs, but tracing their origins through the version history of spacetime itself. Can pinpoint the exact commit (or cosmic event) that introduced a critical error and swiftly apply a patch across all relevant timelines.
        * Why it's fun: Combines a common coding task (debugging) with an extraordinary, time-traveling twist.
        * Icon Idea: A magnifying glass over a clock, or a rewind/fast-forward symbol on a bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="together">
    <h3>* Algorithmic Foreknowledge:</h3>
    <p>
        * Description: Possesses an uncanny ability to predict future software conflicts and performance bottlenecks before they manifest. Develops preemptive solutions, ensuring optimal code efficiency and stability across all projected outcomes.
        * Why it's fun: It's like having a crystal ball for code, making you incredibly valuable.
        * Icon Idea: A brain with gears, or a flowchart leading to a glowing orb.
     </p>
</div>
<div class="together">
    <h3>Cross-Epoch Language Fluency:</h3>
    <p>
        * Description: Fluent in every programming language, from the earliest punch card systems of the mid-20th century to speculative quantum-entangled syntaxes of the far future. Seamlessly translates legacy code into modern frameworks and vice-versa, bridging technological eras.
        * Why it's fun: Exaggerates programming multilingualism to an epic, time-spanning degree.
     </p>
</div>
<div class="together">
    <h3>Paradox-Proof Version Control:</h3>
    <p> 
        * Description: Specializes in managing codebases where parallel development timelines converge. Ensures that no merge conflict results in a temporal paradox or erases critical historical features, maintaining absolute integrity of the project's chronological lineage.
        * Why it's fun: Elevates standard version control (like Git) to a heroic, paradox-avoiding feat.
        * Icon Idea: Intersecting arrows or branches, with a shield or lock symbol.
